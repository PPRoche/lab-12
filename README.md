# Modified Section

1. I believe the basics aspects of the Lab have been correctly implemented. I shared the Heroku application with you and the Web application serves POST /rides with JSON [] as a response for lab 11 and this lab I created a working web app on herokuapp.com with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing enabled on POST /rides resource. However, I wasn't able to link my index.html page which thus caused much confusion and a fundamental unability to update the map. If I had more time, I would've liked to have solved this problem.

2. I worked on this assignment by myself.

3. I spent approximately a five hours on this assignment.
# node-js-getting-started
A barebones Node.js app using [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/).

This application supports the [Getting Started with Node on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs) article - check it out.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Heroku CLI](https://cli.heroku.com/) installed.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git # or clone your own fork
$ cd node-js-getting-started
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

## Deploying to Heroku
